Create a modern, minimal, and professional multi-page React website for a cloud solutions company called Harihar Tech. The website should use React Router for page navigation with three routes: / for Home, /services for Services, and /about for About Us. The site must use Tailwind CSS for styling and follow a dark, clean theme.
The color scheme should be:
Dark Blue #0A192F as the primary background color
White #FFFFFF for text on dark sections
Yellow #FFCC00 as the accent color (for buttons, highlights)
Dark Gray #333333 for text on light backgrounds
Use the Poppins or Inter font from Google Fonts. Maintain a minimal, tech-forward aesthetic with plenty of spacing, modern hover effects, and responsive layout.
Design a sticky navigation bar with three links: Home, Services, and About Us. Highlight the active page with a yellow underline or accent. On mobile, the nav should collapse into a hamburger menu.

For the / Home Page:
Create a Hero Section with a dark blue background and centered white text. It should include:
Headline: “Empowering Growth Through Cloud Innovation”
Subheadline: “Scalable, secure, and future-ready cloud solutions designed to fuel your business success.”
Supporting paragraph starting with: “At Harihar Tech, we enable businesses to thrive in the digital age...”
Three CTA buttons:
1.Get a Free Consultation (yellow background, white text)
2.View Our Solutions (transparent with white border)
3.Partner With Us (as a text link with an icon)
Next, add a Highlights Section with a white background and dark text. Include a grid of four features:
1.Blazing-Fast Deployments
2.Military-Grade Security
3.Expert Engineering Team
Trusted by Growing Businesses Across India
Include a centered quote below:
“Built on reliability. Designed for scale. Delivered with heart.”

For the /services Services Page:
Begin with a section titled “What We Do”, with a subtitle that reinforces cloud innovation. Present five service cards in a responsive grid. Each should include an icon, bold title, and brief description:
1.Cloud Infrastructure Setup — Azure, AWS, or GCP
2.DevOps & Automation — CI/CD, Terraform, and pipelines
3.Security & Compliance — Zero-trust, encryption, and standards like ISO 27001 and HIPAA
4.Monitoring & Optimization — Grafana, Azure Monitor, and cost analysis
5.AI/ML & Data Engineering — Data lakes, analytics pipelines, and ML model deployment
Below this, include a “How It Works” section with four horizontally laid out (or stacked on mobile) steps:
Discover & Assess
Architect the Solution
Deploy & Integrate
Monitor & Support
Use rounded cards with yellow step numbers and soft shadows.

For the /about About Us Page:
Start with a bold centered quote:
“We’re not just a service provider — we’re your cloud partner.”
Add a descriptive paragraph about the team’s passion for cloud engineering, tailored secure solutions, and long-term partnerships. Below this, add a contact box with the following info:
📧 Email: contact@yourcompany.com
📞 Phone: +91 8767937077
📍 Location: Nagpur, India

Close the page with another centered quote:
“We don’t just implement technology — we empower businesses to lead with it.”

Each page should include a Footer visible at the bottom, with a dark blue background, light gray text, and company details. Use Tailwind for responsive layout, spacing (py-20, px-6), soft shadows, hover transitions, and rounded elements throughout. Avoid scroll-based navigation — use React Router exclusively for routing.
